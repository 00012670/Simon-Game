# Simon-Game

## This website was created to play the Simon Game

To start the game, first you need to press any key, and then Simon will show you the button you have to click on. As you move from level to level, the patterns become more and more complex. If you make a mistake, it will tell you that the game is over, so you can press any key to restart the game.
